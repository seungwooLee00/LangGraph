# Registration Guide

## Tuition Payment
- **Payment Period:** Before each semester starts, typically in the third week of February and August for one week.
  - Exact payment dates are announced on the university website ([Sogang University](http://www.sogang.ac.kr)) → "Academic & Student Support" → "Academic Notices".
  - There is no additional payment period; failure to pay tuition within the designated period without approved leave results in expulsion due to unregistered status.
  - Students who fail to pay within the period will have their course registration canceled.
  - Students arriving in Korea should plan their entry date considering the payment period if they intend to pay tuition directly at the bank.

### Tuition Invoice
1. Tuition invoices are not sent by mail.
2. The invoice can be viewed and printed starting one week before the payment period via SAINT → "Registration/Scholarships" → "Tuition Payment Details/Invoice".

### Payment Methods
1. **Virtual Account Payment via Woori Bank:**
   - Deposit the exact amount indicated in your personal virtual account on the tuition invoice.
   - The virtual account is assigned to each student individually, so the sender's name does not need to match the student's name.
   - Ensure the transferred amount exactly matches the invoice amount to avoid issues. Allow 3-4 days for processing if transferring from overseas.

2. **Invoice Payment:**
   - Visit the designated bank with your tuition invoice to make the payment.

### Installment Payment Plan
1. **Installment Amount and Payment Schedule**

   | Payment Period | Amount Due |

   | 2nd Installment | 1/4 of tuition |
   | 3rd Installment | 1/4 of tuition |
   | 4th Installment | 1/4 of tuition |

   - Each installment’s invoice can be printed from SAINT a day before the payment begins. Please refer to SAINT’s tuition invoice for the exact amount.
   - The exact installment payment dates are announced each semester in the tuition payment guide.

2. **Payment Method:**
   - Payments must be made through Woori Bank by visiting the bank or using the virtual account.
   - Up to 4 installments are allowed, automatically processed if the paid amount matches the invoiced installment.

3. **Ineligible for Installment Payment:**
   - Students registered for 8 or more semesters, graduation candidates, students with prior unpaid installments, students who fail to meet payment deadlines, freshmen, transfer, and readmitted students.

## Leave of Absence and Tuition Refund or Deferment
1. Full refunds are available for students who apply for leave before the semester begins. Partial refunds apply if leave is taken after the semester begins.

2. **Refund and Deferment Schedule**
