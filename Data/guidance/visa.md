## Visa Overview

1. According to the Ministry of Justice of Korea, all international students of foreign nationality must hold a Student (D-2) visa before the start of the semester.
2. If you already hold another type of visa, you must directly check with the Immigration Office to confirm if you can study under the current visa. If necessary, you may need to change your visa or obtain permission for activities outside the current visa.
3. Other visa types that allow study activities aside from the Student (D-2) visa:
   - Diplomatic (A-1) to Treaty (A-3), Cultural Arts (D-1), Reporting (D-5) to Trade Management (D-9), Professor (E-1) to Specific Activities (E-7), Family Visit (F-1) to Marriage Immigration (F-6), or any other residence status that permits study activities.

## Visa Types

2. **General Training (D-4) Visa**
   - Required for individuals who plan to stay in Korea for Korean language training at a Korean Language Institute. If a student with a D-4 visa enters a regular academic program, they must change to a D-2 visa before the semester begins.

3. **Short-term Visit (C-3) Visa**
   - The C-3 visa is for short-term visitors (up to 90 days) for purposes such as tourism, transit, medical treatment, or visiting relatives. C-3 visa holders are not allowed to enroll in regular academic programs. If you enter Korea with a C-3 visa, you must change to a D-2 visa before the semester starts.
   - Note: If you enter Korea with a Group Tourist (C-3-2), Medical Tourism (C-3-3), or General Tourism (C-3-9) visa, you cannot change to a D-2 visa within Korea. You must return to your home country, obtain a D-2 visa, and then re-enter Korea.
